# Operating Systems Course

## Overview

This repository contains materials and exercises for the Operating Systems course. The course covers theoretical concepts, system programming using shell scripting and C, and hands-on lab activities in a UNIX/Linux environment.

## Course Structure

-1. Introduction

--Classification of Operating Systems, with a focus on multi-user and multiprocess systems.

--The Operating System as a resource manager.

--Introduction to processes and threads: scheduling and deadlock problems.

--Memory management fundamentals, including virtual memory.

--File and directory management: logical and physical organization of the File System.

-2. System Programming with Command Languages (Approx. 2 CFU)

--Basic command-line utilities.

Writing shell scripts, including recursive scripts, using a UNIX Shell.

3. System Programming in C for UNIX (Approx. 3 CFU)

Low-level file access primitives: open, creat, close, read, write, and lseek.

Process management primitives: fork, exit, wait, pipe, signal, and kill.

Process communication and synchronization mechanisms.

4. Operating Systems Laboratory (Approx. 3 CFU)

Hands-on exercises in a UNIX/Linux environment.

Practical implementation of system programming in both Shell and C.

Final project: a recursive file system search tool combining Shell scripting and C programming for efficient coordination.
